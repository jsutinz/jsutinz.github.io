         data-title="Stud-E Study Helper Robot"
         data-description="<h4>Ideation</h4>
         <p>The robot was created for a school project, which required that we use certain components and had certain requirements that must be fulfilled. 
          The problem that our robot was designed to solve was to aid students in studying, by providing snacks/treats for them. 
          The intention was that it would slowly drive around a table of students that were studying and ask if they would like anything dispensed. 
          It would then dispense the student's selection and continue on its path. <br> <br>
          Below is a concept sketch of our robot, which mostly matches our final design.</p>
         <img src='stude-embed-1.png' alt='Stud-E robot''/>

         <h4>Issues</h4>
         <p>Our robot, lovingly named Stud-E (internally named Wall-E), had to go through many design iterations (as expected) before taking on his final form. 
          Some of the major design changes include:
          <ul>
            <li>Changing the dispensing mechanism from the originally planned cartridges, to a rotating hopper that had dividers.</li>
            <li>Changing the accuracy requirement of the dispensing mechanism (less accuracy in amount of items dispensed needed).</li>
            <li>Changing the placement of most of the sensors and EV3 brick to be in side the chassis (box).</li>
          </ul> <br>
          Below shows one of the first prototypes including all the necessary components needed for the dispensing mechanism to work. 
          The flap (left motor) would later be changed to move in a different axis to reduce the space the assembly took up.</p>
          <img src='stude-embed-2.jpg' alt='Stud-E robot''/>
          
          <h4>Design Work</h4>
          <p>The design of our custom parts was mostly split up, I ended up designing parts of the track system, and the chassis. 
            The tracks themselves were a design from Thingiverse, the gears were from Thingiverse, but modified to fit our parts. 
            The plates that sandwich the tracks and the tensioning mechanism were all designed in-house, and fastened together (as well as to the chassis) with 6-32 x 1-1/2 machine screws. 
            The chassis itself was prototyped out of HDF, with the final iteration being laser cut out of acrylic. 
            The chassis is littered with holes that line up with Lego pieces so that we could change around the placement of parts inside the chassis using Lego Technic bricks and pieces. <br> <br>
            Pictured below is the first prototype of the chassis for Stud-E which was made of MDF instead of the final acrylic as it was cheaper.</p>

         data-title="Injection Molded Steering Wheel Grips"
         data-description="
         <h4>Background</h4>
         <p>The steering wheel that the grips are for belong to the electric gokart project at Electrium Mobility. 
          During my co-op with Electrium I was tasked with creating the molds for the grips as well as updating the design of the custom paddle shifters.
          The reason that injection molding was determined to be the method used to create the grips was because it would be the most durable and provide the most comfort.
          Comparatively, other methods like a 2 piece grip which sandwiches the steering wheel plate (used by other design teams like Midnight Sun) have known issues which we tried to avoid with our method.</p>
          
        <h4>Design of Mold</h4>
        <p>The overall design of the molds followed <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vV7jRAVwR1evtPnTu0fTfdmM2aUsuoUPU-df7nERoBg/edit?tab=t.0' target='_blank'>a document</a> 
          as making molds is a brand new topic to me, so being able to have the main design points in a document was extremely helpful.
          Some of the main design considerations were: 
            <ul>
              <li>Having air venting for bubbles to escape from</li>
              <li>Where to place the vents and material inlet to avoid places where pockets of air could form</li>
              <li>How to align, secure, and position mold in relation to the steering wheel plate</li>
            </ul> </p>

         data-title="Charging Lamp Project"
         data-description="
         <h4>Design Process</h4>
         <p>This project was inspired by the traditional Japanese woodworking pattern called kumiko, which is makes use of a repeating geometric pattern that is usually assembled without nails. 
          After setting some design goals, I got started working out the design in concepts sketches. 
          After I felt that I had a working design (below) I started to transfer the concepts into SolidWorks.</p>
          <img src='lamp-embed-1.jpg' alt='Sketch of lamp design''/> <br>
          
        <h4>Design/Manufacturing Difficulties</h4>
        <p>I started out by creating the inner tube and kumiko-pattern diffuser first, as I wanted to test out how well the diffusion was without a dedicated diffusing piece. 
          Since the LED strips themselves were already well diffused, combined with the paper, made for an even spread of light. 
          The inside tube was printed from white PLA as to reflect as much light as possible, and allowed for the wires of the LED strip to be routed into the base of the lamp. 
          <br> <br>
        An issue that I ran into was with the manufacturing of the kumiko pattern. 
        In hindsight, 3D printing the kumiko piece was not be best option, as a lot of post-processing needed to be done, because of the supports required for the print. 
        Additionally, the kumiko pattern being 3D printed also made the piece very fragile, as the thin pieces of the pattern could snap at the layer lines if too much force was applied to them. 
        If I had the option to, I would have had each kumiko panel laser cut, which would have been much easier and stronger.</p>
        <img src='lamp-embed-2.jpg' alt='Lamp shroud''/> <br>
        
        <h4>Wiring/Charging Hub</h4>
         <p>The LED strip is powered via USB, which is perfect for my case as I can just plug it into the charging hub. 
          However, the USB ports are right on the front of the hub, so the charging hub had to be inset into the base enough so that the USB connection for the LED strip can be plugged in internally. 
          The LED strip also came with inline controls, which I took advantage of and integrated into the base. 
          The buttons in the case were designed to be print-in-place, so that I didn't need to assemble them separately. 
          Since I was using an off-the-shelf USB charging hub, it took up more space inside the base as a result of the housing. 
          This meant that there needed to be wire management cutouts in the base so that everything could fit together into the base.</p>
